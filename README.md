## üí° Assumptions made during development

- **C#** was chosen as the server side:  
Because it is a high-level language that leads to correct and structured thinking in system development.  
It allows for professional-level maintenance, high security, and clean code management.

- **React** was chosen as the client side:  
Because it is a modern and flexible solution with advanced tools, a wide community,  
and great support for rapid development of user interfaces.

- **Use of a local database**:  
Since the system was built for educational purposes and not as a commercial product,  
there was no requirement for an external database.  
A local solution provides a perfect solution in such projects.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Project Locally

### üñ•Ô∏è Frontend

```bash
npm start
```

The React app will open in your browser at:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

---

### üîå Backend

Open the solution file (`.sln`) located in the `server` directory using **Visual Studio**.

Once opened, click on **Run (F5)** to start the backend server.

The backend server will typically be available at:

```
http://localhost:5000
```

## ‚úÖ Everything Is Ready!

You now have both the frontend and backend running locally.  
Feel free to customize, build, and experiment! üéâ
